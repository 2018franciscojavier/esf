# 1. Retrieve daily measurements from three nearby meteorological stations (time series length 10 years).
# 2. /(Session #2) Filter each time series using physical limits/.
# 3. Compute a daily time series representative of the region with the average of the three time series. Compare this time series with each station using statistical metrics (MBD, RMSD, MAD).
# 4. Choose a location inside the perimeter defined by the three stations, and estimate the daily solar radiation using spatial interpolation (IDW).
# 5. Retrieve monthly averages of solar radiation from a satellite service (preferably CMSAF, with QGis or similar software) for a region covering the three stations.
# 6. Compare the values at the three locations with the monthly averages of the measurements provided by the stations using statistical metrics.
# 7. Combine the satellite estimations at the location defined in step 4 with the result of that step, using spatial interpolation (IDW). 

# *The result of step 6 will be used in Session #2*.
