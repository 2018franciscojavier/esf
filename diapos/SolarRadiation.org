* Motivation

** Radiation and PV Systems

- The energy produced by a PV system depends mainly on the solar radiation incident on the PV generator.

- Consequently, the estimation of performance of a PV system in a location during a time period requires the knowledge of the available solar radiation.

* Key concepts
** Solar Radiation cannot be computed
- Solar radiation reaching the earth surface is the result of *complex interactions with the atmosphere*.
- On-site measurements or satellite images are required for solar radiation estimation.

** Inclination Angle
- PV generators have an *inclination angle higher than zero* to maximize the performance.
- The generator inclination angle depends on the latitude of the location and on the application[fn:1].

** Solar Radiation Databases
- Therefore, it is unfeasible to maintain a database of incident solar radiation.
- Databases register solar radiation on the horizontal plane.
- Estimation of the solar irradiation *incident on the inclined plane* requires a transposition procedure. 


** From Horizontal to Inclined

* Definitions

** Irradiance and Irradiation
- Irradiance :: solar radiation *power* received by a surface per unit area.
  - Units: $\si{\watt\per\meter\squared},\,\si{\kilo\watt\per\meter\squared}$
- Irradiation :: solar radiation *energy* received by a surface per unit area.
  - Units: $\si{\watthour\per\meter\squared},\,\si{\kilo\watthour\per\meter\squared}$
  - Hourly irradiation, Daily irradiation, Monthly irradiation ...

** Extraterrestrial Solar Radiation

- $B_0$: Solar radiation energy/power at the top of the Earth's atmosphere on a surface perpendicular to the solar rays.
- $B_0 \simeq \SI{1367}{\watt\per\meter\squared}$ (Solar Constant) 
- $B_0(0)$, extraterrestrial irradiance on a horizontal plane, can be computed by analytical means.
  - Depends on the latitude, day of the year, hour of the day. 

** Interaction with the Atmosphere

Due to the interaction with the atmosphere, the extraterrestrial radiation is absorbed, reflected and scattered.

** Diffuse, Beam, and Global

- Solar radiation reaching the Earth surface is named *global solar radiation*.
- It is the result of three components:
  - *Beam Radiation*: solar radiation traveling on a straight line from the sun to the receiving surface.
  - *Diffuse Radiation*: solar radiation scattered by the atmosphere. It is emitted from all directions of the sky.
  - *Albedo or Reflected Radiation*: solar radiation reflected by the ground.

** Horizontal, Incident, Effective

- $G(0)$ *Radiation on a Horizontal Plane* 
  - Measurements from ground stations, or satellite images.
- $G(\alpha, \beta)$ *Radiation incident on an Inclined Plane*
  - Transposition from radiation on the horizontal plane.
- $G_{ef}(\alpha, \beta)$ *Effective Radiation incident on a PV module*
  - Reflectance and transmittance of the PV module depend on the angle of incidence.
  - Dirt losses.

[fn:1] Rule of thumb: latitude minus 10ยบ for a Grid Connected PV System; latitude plus 10ยบ for a Standalone PV System.
