* Motivation
** Solar Variability
- *Extraterrestrial* solar radiation is a *deterministic process* (it depends on latitude, day of year, and time of day).
- However, *global radiation* is a *stochastic (random) process* because of the interaction with the atmosphere:
  - Time variability
  - Spatial variability

** Long-term Estimations
We are interested in *long-term estimations* of the performance of PV systems in a definite location.

Solar radiation data sources must:
  - *capture the long-term behaviour* (interannual variability), and
  - be *representative of the specified location* (spatial variability).

** Time Variability
#+ATTR_LATEX: :height 0.4\textheight
[[../figs/VariabilidadRadiacionDiario.pdf]]

*** Key concepts

- Time variability *increases with time resolution* (higher for daily values than for monthly averages).
- Fluctuations are *higher in winter than in summer*.
- Reproducing *long-term trends* requires *long time series* (about 10 years length).

** Spatial Variability

#+ATTR_LATEX: :height 0.4\textheight
[[../figs/SpatialVariability.jpg]]

*** Key concepts

- Spatial variability depends on the *local climatology*.
- Spatial variability is *higher in winter than in summer* (for a same location).
- Measurements are representative of nearby locations for a *limited distance* (about 10 kms.)

** Summary: Measurements requirements
*** 
*Reliable* and *representative* *long-term estimations* of PV performance require:
  - *Nearby measurements*: $\leq \SI{10}{km}$
  - *Long time series*: $\simeq \SI{10}{years}$

* Data Sources
** Meteorological stations

  - Long time series.
  - High time resolution ($\SI{1}{\min}$)
  - Low spatial resolution (point measurements).
  - Errors due to meter inaccuracy (no models required).

** Satellite imaging

  - Low time resolution ($\SI{1}{hour}$ or $\SI{1}{day}$).

  - High spatial resolution ($\SI{15}{km}$).

  - Global solar radiation is estimated by processing images of the satellite radiometers.

  - Errors due model inaccuracy (radiation is estimated).

** Hybrid methods

Ground measurements merged with satellite estimations to increase spatial resolution:
    - *Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW)* ($x_0$ is the point where the estimation is required, $x_i$ are the points with measurements available, $d$ is the distance between locations $x_0$ and $x_i$)
      #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
      \[
      \widehat{G}_d(x_0) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N w_i G_{d}(x_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^N w_i} 
      \]

      \[
	w_i = 1/d^2(x_0, x_i)
      \]

* Quality Control
** Motivation
Measurements must be *filtered* and *corrected* to remove erroneous data and outliers.
  - Physical limits
  - Spatial coherence
  - Statistical analysis of deviations


** Physical limits

- *Upper limit*: daily global irradiation cannot exceed extraterrestrial solar irradiation (daily clearness index[fn:2] cannot exceed 1).
#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
\[
G_d(0) \leq B_{0d}(0)
\]

\[
  K_{dT} \leq 1
\]
#+END_EXPORT

- *Lower limit*: clearness index must be higher than 0.03
#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
  \[
  K_t = \frac{G_d(0)}{B_{0d}(0)} \geq 0.03
  \]
#+END_EXPORT

** Spatial coherence

Solar radiation measurements must be coherent between stations in a region.

- Measurements from a station should be compared with *nearby stations* (for example, using IDW spatial interpolation)
- Comparison must be established with *aggregated values* (daily or monthly averages).

** Statistical Analysis of Deviations

- Deviations, $\mathbf{D}$, between Observations, $\mathbf{O}$, and a Model, $\mathbf{M}$ (or another set of observations):

#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
\[
\mathbf{O} = \left\{ o_1 \dots o_n \right\}
\]

\[
\mathbf{M} = \left\{ m_1 \dots m_n  \right\}
\]

\[
\mathbf{D} = \mathbf{M} - \mathbf{O} =  \left\{ (m_1 - o_1) \dots (m_n - o_n)  \right\} = \left\{ d_1 \dots d_n  \right\}
\]

** Metrics

- Mean Bias Difference (MBD):
#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
  \[
  MBE = \overline{\mathbf{D}} = \overline{\mathbf{M}} - \overline{\mathbf{O}} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (m_i - o_i)
  \]
#+END_EXPORT

- Root Mean Square Difference (RMSD):
#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
  \[
  RMSD = \left(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n d_i^2 \right)^{1/2} =  \left( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (m_i - o_i)^2  \right)^{1/2}
  \]
#+END_EXPORT

- Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD):

#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
  \[
  MAD = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left|d_i\right| =  \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left|m_i - o_i\right|
  \]

* Footnotes

[fn:2] Clearness index is defined as the ratio $K_{dT} = G_d(0) / B_{0d}(0)$. 

[fn:1] Rule of thumb: latitude minus 10ยบ for a Grid Connected PV System; latitude plus 10ยบ for a Standalone PV System.
